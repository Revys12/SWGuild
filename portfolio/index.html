                                <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>

                                        <p> Guitarist // Producer // Song-Writer </p>

                                        <p>I'm a mixed bag of formally schooled and self-taught as a song-writer, which is
                                           an odd combination for most musicians today. But, crossing boundaries and mixing
                                           ideas that wouldn't normally don't go together is my favorite thing about art. </p>

                                        <p>Working with me is an endless game of experimentation. Let's take an idea,
                                           turn it on it's head, and then try it out 5 different ways. The best version,
                                           or at least, the one that feels the most accurate to the moment will reveal
                                           itself in the process. The more I've been in music, the more I've been feeling
                                           that I don't write songs as much as I learn to discover them.</p>

                                 <h2><em>Experience</em></h2>

                                        <p> My love of atmosphere and cascading dynamic builds has defined a lot of what I produce.
                                            Much of my music revolves around creating textures and soundscapes to transport
                                            listeners into a sonic story-telling.</p>

                                        <p>Music has always merged out of jam sessions. The Fairlead was the first music project
                                           that grew into something bigger than infancy. Opening for acts like Switchfoot, Gungor,
                                           and Caspian and playing shows around the Midwest was a great stepping stone
                                           for me into the music business and starting a life-long career of music making. </p>

                                        <p>My most current project is one I'm working on with my wife, called Syvers.
                                           It's a duo project that has focused mostly on our relationship and processing
                                           the ups and downs of being married and the shared experiences that you end up
                                           walking through together. Some of my best song-writing to date, especially
                                           lyrically, has come through the process of writing with Sarah. </p>

                                 <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>

                                        <p>When I'm not making music or behind a sound board, I love playing sports.
                                           Pick-up games of basketball and soccer or a good round of golf are all some
                                           great ways that I can get out of my headspace and exercise. I've never
                                           really been one to spend time in the gym. I don't like lifting weights for
                                           the sake of lifting weights, but if you put some sort of ball and rules
                                           attached, I'm way more interested.</p>

                                        <p>I also enjoy a good TV show or film. Sarah and I are huge fans of The Office
                                           and we quote it constantly. Sometimes, I wish somewhere out there in the real
                                           world, there was Michael Scott just doing his day to day work at Dunder-Mifflin.
                                           Everybody knows somebody who has some similarities to Michael, but nobody can
                                           really pull together all of his unique mannerisms and off-the-wall responses to
                                           life. I think that's a big reason why the show is as good as it is.</p>
