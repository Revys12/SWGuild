                              grown to be a staple of the Northwest Seattle neighborhoods.
                              Beginning as a brewery and growing into a full-scale restaurant,
                              the drive for distinct flavor that started with the first batch
                              of Cedar Cabin has defined the process for selecting each item on the menu.
                              Combining American classics with the taste of Italian, the flavors
                              are bold and interpretetations unparalleled. Stop in for a Seattle taste
                              you can't get anywhere else.
